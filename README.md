ðŸš€ Building a Simple Calculator: A Lesson in HTML, CSS, and Minimal JavaScript ðŸ§®

Excited to share a recent project where I built a simple yet elegant calculator using HTML, CSS, and just a touch of JavaScript. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»

The goal was to create a functional calculator with a clean and centered design while minimizing the use of JavaScript. This approach not only highlights the power of CSS for styling but also demonstrates how to handle basic interactions with minimal scripting.

Highlights:
HTML: Structuring the calculator's layout with a clear and intuitive design.
CSS: Styling the calculator to have a sleek, white look with a leather-like button effect, all while keeping it centered on the screen across different devices.
JavaScript: Implementing basic functionalities like appending values, clearing the display, and calculating results with just a few lines of code.
This project is a great example for teaching students how to combine these technologies to create a functional web application with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

Feel free to check out the code and see how a little creativity can go a long way! ðŸ’¡
